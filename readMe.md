# Golf Handicap and Statistics Platform

Created by: Patrick McGinnis

#### THINGS TO DO:

As of writing this there is no front end. This thing operates from the console. Need to implement a front end preferably through web.

#### Goal: 

Create a scalable web application individuals can use to monitor and analyze their statistics from previous golf rounds.
This thing might be better implemented as a mobile application. Who knows but as of right now lets do web and the back end with python.

#### Note:

There may be many structures and things that are over engineered for this project. I am using this not only to build something but to implement 
as many different data structures and apply algorithms for practice.
