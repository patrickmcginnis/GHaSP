# Golf Handicap and Statistics Platform

Created by: Patrick McGinnis

####THINGS TO DO:

As of writing this there is no front end. This thing operates from the console. Need to implement a front end preferably through web.

####Goal: 

Create a scalable web application individuals can use to monitor and analyze their statistics from previous golf rounds.
This thing might be better implemented as a mobile application. Who knows but as of right now lets do web and the back end with python.

####Note:

The writing in here is going to come off as very 'thought diarrhea' esque. Just go with it, im working alone and talking to an imaginary person. 
Helps with the flow Ill clean it up later.

There may be many structures and things that are over engineered for this project. I am using this not only to build something but to implement 
as many different data structures and apply algorithms to those for practice.
